# The Problem statement for Que 2 is

## Write the output for the following recursive code snippet for n = 3:
'''
void fun(int n)
{
if(n > 0)
{
cout<<n;
fun(n - 1);
cout<<n;
}
}
'''

## The output for this program would be 321123

Since there is no space for output the output will look like this **321123**
The over all time Complexity for this program will be O(n).
