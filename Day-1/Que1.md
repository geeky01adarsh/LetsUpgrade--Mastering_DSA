# The Problem statement for Que 1 is

## What is the time complexity T(n) for the following code snippet?

'''
a = 1
b = 1
while(b <= n)
{
a += 1
b += 1
cout<<"Hi";
}
'''

## Answer of this question would be O(n).
Here the value of b is incrementing by 1 in a loop so the loop will execute 'n' times. Thus the overall Time Complexity would be **O(n)**
